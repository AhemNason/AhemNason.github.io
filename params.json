  "body": "### BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nahemnason is Mike Nason,  a Scholarly Communications Librarian at the University of New Brunswick in sunny Fredericton, New Brunswick. He cares about things like open access to scholarly research and digital scholarship literacy. That's pretty fun. He works on repositories, outreach, digital projects, and sometimes reference. He doesn't \"wear many hats\" because he thinks that expression is super dumb... unless it is in reference to cycling caps. \r\n\r\nIn his spare time he plays instruments, enjoys a good downward dog. IPAs, beards, plaid scarves, steel-framed bicycles... the whole deal. You know. \r\n\r\nYou can reach him if you try.     \r\nHe has faith in you. \r\n\r\n ",
