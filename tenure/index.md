To the Assessment Committee,

What follows is my written statement of consideration for tenure in the position of _Scholarly Communications and Publishing Librarian_ as per the Dean of Libraries request, May 1, 2017. With this document, I've also provided a recent copy of my CV, as well as supplementary materials as outlined within this document.

---

I have held three separate librarian positions at UNB Libraries: Academic Services Librarian, Digital Repository and Metadata Librarian, and Scholarly Communications and Publishing Librarian. Each of these positions has played a part in the narrative of my growth at UNB libraries. The former two positions were term-based and assigned more specific roles than the position for which I am currently being evaluated. Because of the unique nature of the work I do, I felt it useful to spend some time reviewing the specifics of my shorter contracts. From my perspective, those positions are reflective of the work I do – and the sort of librarian I am – today.

In the Fall of 2013, I started my career at UNB Libraries as a vaguely-labelled _Academic Services Librarian_. The position was a brief contract (originally intended to only last six months), afforded to me to assist with instructional/service needs within the Reference Department. I was also tasked with unloading my institutional memory from the _Electronic Text Centre's_ hosted journals operation. Though the position was short-lived, it proved to be quite useful in acclimating me to the work of the Reference Department in general. It placed me alongside liaison librarians in a way that, I feel, has assisted greatly in my understanding of roles, dynamics, and culture within UNB Libraries.

Starting in January 2014, I became the _Digital Repository and Metadata Librarian_. I spent approximately two years in this project-based position and, as such, it framed a great deal of the work that has come to represent my everyday. Many of the requirements of the role were more specific versions of the broad roles outlined in my current one.  Although my shift to Scholarly Communications was effective in late 2015, a significant amount of my time was spent on the continued development and support of the institutional repository. This distinction is important. It is likely that the content recruitment, outreach, research data management, and other non-repository based tasks assigned under the broad title of Scholarly Communications went largely unaddressed for a portion of this time period specifically to facilitate continued development of our repository and the Islandora platform. It is for this reason that I've included some of the specifics of the _Digital Repository and Metadata Librarian_ role in this document.

As it stands currently, the Scholarly Communications and Publishing Librarian role has the following responsibilities:

>- Lead the continuing development of UNB's institutional repository, UNB Scholar; liaise with the Library Systems Group to optimize repository software; provide outreach and promotion, content recruitment, metadata creation, policy development, and ongoing assessment and reporting for the repository.
- Develop and deliver instruction services and assistance for faculty, students, and researchers on scholarly publishing, open access, grant-funded publication requirements, research metrics, and related issues.
- Monitor emerging trends (including new technologies) and changes in scholarly communication and research dissemination; communicate impact and implications to the UNB community.
- Advocate for author's rights, and advice faculty, students, and researchers on publishing agreements and options, including open access to scholarship.
- Guide the development of research data management services at UNB Libraries, particularly with respect to data management planning and open access to research data.
- Work with the Centre for Digital Scholarship's digital publishing staff to support the Library's journals publishing program and other digital publishing initiatives.
- Represent UNB Libraries in appropriate local, regional, and national initiatives concerning scholarly communication and digital publishing.

Also relevant are articles 16C, 19C, 25C, 25F of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). In short, this document is an effort to illustrate my effectiveness in meeting my assigned responsibilities against the backdrop of the following principles:

- supports the academic work of the University by providing professional consultation and assistance to library users
- demonstrates professional competence in field
- performance of assigned responsibilities in an effective manner
- acceptable record of committee service in the library or elsewhere in the university
- continuing efforts to keep up with advances in profession
- research and professional development

## Development and Support of UNB Scholar

UNB Scholar has taken up a tremendous amount of my time and focus in the four years of my career as a librarian. All of the work done in my term contract as _Digital Repository and Metadata Librarian_ remains relevant to the way I approach issues regarding repositories and repository software platforms in general. There were lessons learned in metadata, policy, outreach, content recruitment, technical literacy, interdepartmental relationships, university politics, and instruction. It shaped much of who I am now professionally, and has played a role in my reputation within my own community of practice.

It is for these reasons that I have decided to express some detail here on UNB Scholar/Islandora development. This context is important to me, and to where UNB Libraries have been in this space.

### Context for Islandora (Looking Backwards)

In the Winter of 2013 – not long after the faculty strike – I'd met with members of the Faculty of Law who alerted me to an issue where materials within our repository, _RiverRun_, were inappropriately labelled and added to the repository without any consultation. One of these materials had been a donation to the library by a faculty member who was shown in the repository – falsely – as having authored the work. Additionally, the faculty present at this meeting had expressed great displeasure at the unilateral way the repository had been originally populated. Shortly thereafter, in a meeting with a few members of the Department of English, I was made aware of similar complaints about a number of their works listed in the repository as well. Listserv conversations had been posted to the repository without permission; publications had been added without any communication. Folks seemed pretty unhappy.

Two things were clear to me almost immediately. The first was that the ingest process for _RiverRun_ was done with little oversight and minimal communication with researchers. The second was that in the two intervening years between the vacancy of the repository manager's position and my hiring, the repository had not been touched other than the addition of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). There was little-to-no documentation about the repository – or initiatives related to it – to review.

_RiverRun_ had been flagged for replacement before my hiring. The open-source repository software platform known as DSpace had been problematic for our systems group. There were a handful of issues at the time, but the most pressing was that it was written in the programming language Java. Java is not a language our systems team supports. The library systems group and the director of the ETC made/endorsed the decision to move to the Islandora platform. Islandora is based on the Drupal content management system (CMS) which is written in PHP. Our systems team is very experienced in that language and with Drupal in general. Discovery Garden – a for-profit offshoot of the Islandora development community – were hired to port the Scholar Module (Islandora's institutional repository component) to the latest version of the software.

In conversations with Erik Moore, we felt it was necessary to restrict access to all faculty publications listed in the repository until we could confirm their validity. Unfortunately, DSpace would have required each record to be restricted manually. There were thousands of records. Additionally, there was very little actual content in the repository. Most faculty content merely consisted of a citation, unlinked to publications. Feeling the pressure to preempt any further possible damage from the problematic faculty collections within _RiverRun_, and with Islandora deployment seemingly around the corner, we decided to archive _RiverRun_ and focus on migrating to the new platform.

#### Islandora Software Deployment and Development

To put things gently, the deployment of Islandora was not a smooth process. The decision to shut down _RiverRun_ was made in February of 2014. I did not receive my keys to our Islandora platform – later named _UNB Scholar_ – locally until mid-summer of that year. Much of the delay was the result of communications issues and complications with [Discovery Garden](http://www.discoverygarden.ca/), as well as struggles with the Islandora software stack itself. The "Scholar" module bundled with Islandora behaved in ways we felt were counterproductive, resulting in shifting approaches to storage and organisation of content in Islandora. Our deployment was less a "launch" so much as a first step, and the majority of my time since Summer 2014 has been consumed by development work, documentation, meetings, design, metadata work, migration plans, and user testing. Development has included:

- cursory, initial design and template work (later re-done by systems)
- development and testing of [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) metadata for Islandora forms
    - working with Merle Steeves in cataloguing towards appropriate MODS records for theses and dissertations based on AACR2 cataloguing standards
    - re-writing Islandora Scholar MODS forms to allow for variable types of content metadata
    - establishment of campus-agnostic controlled vocabulary terms for metadata organisation
- consistent, close work with systems (Jake Sanford, notably) in identifying issues, bugs, potential development opportunities, and _a lot of testing/failure/re-testing_
- support for [Senior Report](https://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca/senior-reports) project at the sci/for and engineering libraries
    - oversight for initial migration
    - forms development
    - workflow development for sci/for and engineering library staff to add/edit Senior Reports
    - continued support for engineering and sci/for library staff engaging in Senior Reports project
- support for [electronic theses and dissertations](https://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca/etd) uploads/ingest/migration
    - training Rob Glencross in Islandora
    - form development
    - workflow recommendations and development – has since spun into broader oversight work with ETD working group to locate missing theses and make technical recommendations to the graduate school.
- content recruitment and ingest
    - manual uploads of submitted content
    - workflow development
    - form modifications and additions per file types
    - content recruitment planning and testing
    - a focus group meeting with science/engineering faculty and also humanities/social science faculty, co-run with Marc Bragdon
- [policy](https://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca/node/13) development with _UNB Scholar_ advisory group
- semi-regular meetings with _UNB Scholar_ advisory group
- regular meetings with _UNB Scholar_ implementation committee group
- presentations both internal and external on the progress and development of _UNB Scholar_

This period was also characterised by consistent efforts to embrace the Islandora community. I attended Islandora Camp for hands-on repository training, and also my first Open Repositories conference, where I learned a great deal about the broader repository community and began building relationships with developers, librarians, and organizations within repository space. I also joined a number of Islandora interest groups as a result, including the "Metadata Interest Group" and the "IR Interest Group".

#### Initial Islandora Processes and Policy Development

Repository workflow processes have been a moving target throughout my time across these positions. I started out with the Senior Reports migration project. I developed a [workflow and associated documentation](https://github.com/unb-libraries/unbscholar-docs) for staff at the science/forestry and engineering libraries. Within the first year of the repository we also developed workflows for:

- cataloguing and updating metadata for ETDs
- uploading and keeping records for ETDs
- reporting issues to systems
- creating faculty profiles

As more library staff and/or librarians spent time with the software or emailing back and forth, the workflows changed. We started out trying to make Islandora more intuitive and user-friendly, failed a bunch because Islandora is inherently not user-friendly, and sought new ways to move ahead. At nearly every turn of the process, it became increasingly clear that hands-on use of the repository for a broad base of users was a somewhat unrealistic goal for our institution. Much of the original workflow development intended to help interested/invested parties jump into uploading documents to the repository. Now, documentation hosted on our staff site is predominantly about who to pass specific tasks to for specialised services. For example, even though I spent lots of time working on new forms in Islandora that would be easier for faculty to use, we ultimately decided – relatively recently – that it didn't make sense for faculty to submit directly. Instead, we opt to leverage my time (or Aggie's time) differently, and I simply make the submissions by hand.

Candidly, the development of universal workflows has been a consistent struggle. Let us use liaison librarians as an example. Each librarian has a differing relationship with their faculty. Also, each librarian is varied in their technical literacy. Individual disciplines approach digital scholarship in different ways. Technical literacy amongst faculty is just as varied as it is among librarians. This variety amongst the community has been the largest hurdle in developing extensive, coherent documentation and workflows for everyone. As a result, many of my efforts in this field were as useful to some as they were frustrating for others. But, I would argue, these frustrations were instrumental in my development. I would know less about my colleagues and less about the researchers they support without their guidance and feedback in these areas.

**Policy**

A policy for _UNB Scholar_ was co-developed with the _UNB Scholar_ Advisory Group using the OpenDOAR policy framework. It lives on the repository website: https://unbscholar.lib.unb.ca/node/13

### Continued Development of _UNB Scholar_ (Looking Forward)

Today, the repository houses ~7300 objects, the vast majority of which are actual text datastreams. A large portion of these objects are Forestry, Computer Science, and Engineering Senior Reports. We have also collected:

- 444 Electronic Theses and Dissertations // This collection is of particular note in that we have identified a number of issues in the ETD workflow at UNB and are working on a report that – with the feedback and support of the School of Graduate Studies – might better ensure the preservation and accessibility of student work moving forward. Additionally, many more theses are slated for ingest as we digitize older material.
- 68 working papers from Economics.
- A collection of papers from the Mactaquac Aquatic Ecosystem Study on the Mactaquac head pond in the lead-up to the province's decision on the future of the dam. A project of the Canadian Rivers Institute.
- A collection of papers from the Second Language Research Institute of Canada
- 46 Articles
- 34 Technical Reports

I feel like it would be easy to dismiss this number as small, but it is worth addressing some of the challenges we have uncovered in populating the repository. I mention these not as excuses, but as explanations.

- Applicable content is often ephemeral // We've investigated hundreds of policies for journal articles submitted to us for review by interested faculty members. Typically, publisher PDFs are not allowed as a repository version. Preprints are almost always allowed, but faculty comfort regarding distribution of preprints is variable, or they no longer have them in their possession. Postprints are ideal, but because researchers only receive these as emailed proofs from publishers and tend not to hold on to them, they are even more elusive. We might investigate hundreds of publications and find that 10-20% of those have an open access component. The odds of researchers having the applicable version of the article on hand is just as low. These low yields on large swaths of recruitment are why I now advocate to faculty as directly as possible to save postprints. This issue is pervasive across institutional repositories the world over.
- Faculty interest outstrips ability to commit // Over the last year, I have met with a number of faculty members or organizations one-on-one to explain the repository and recommend services. Often, this has led to faculty members submitting full CVs for review by the copyright office. We return the review, and receive no follow-up from the faculty or they express that they are stressed for time. This suggests that submissions need to be easier, and perhaps it is better to catch faculty as they publish instead of well after-the-fact.
- Some disciplines are more receptive to open access than others.

These issues aside, the questions I receive regarding open access and publications have grown steadily in my time. Often there are curiosities in meeting the Tri-Agency Open Access Policy that led to direct assistance with researchers. As my relationship with ORS staff has grown, so too have my interactions with researchers seeking funding. I now have a place in presentations to faculty writing grant applications – hosted by ORS – to explain how they can meet OA requirements.

My belief, throughout, is that UNB Scholar represents a unique opportunity to represent – in a tangible way – the products of research that happen at UNB in a way that is accessible to the people of this province. I continue to believe this is essential both for our scholars in terms of improving the impact of their research, and the institution in better proving the worth of the university to the people of the province.

From the technical side, I still very much manage the growth and general arc of our IR, even though I spend less time with configurations and settings. And, as we grow further in our services I also play a role in the management of our new [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/)-based [Research Data Repository](https://dataverse.lib.unb.ca/). Predominantly, the plan for continued growth has been to focus on developing relationships between researchers, liaisons, the Office of Research Services, and any other invested parties. As our service requirements grow, we could find it necessary to make non-trivial changes to Islandora or even switch platforms altogether. We already have a list of development requirements and potential development projects, including:

- enabling stats modules and/or supporting other metrics options
- modifications to content view for hosted video
- fixing google scholar indexing issues
- additional forms for varied content types
- [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) API integration
- Scopus API integration
- [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) API integration
- generated "covers" for PDF pre-/post-print options
- mediated deposit platform

This work is not something I can or should take on independently. Our systems group is imminently skilled but taxed with a full development/maintenance schedule. Many of these modifications or changes require hands-on development and significant time commitments from our developers, who are also essential to the library in many other ways. They are a vital, finite resource, and their time must be carefully managed. It is also important to note that development of a software stack like Islandora (or, really, any platform) never actually stops. One is never "finished" their repository. We are always in need of new features, changes, and fixes. Trends change also. When we launched _UNB Scholar_, services like ORCID were less common, for example. Websites for sharing scholarship such as SSRN, Academia.edu, ResearchGate, Zenodo, and Arxiv were less prominent. The narratives for data repositories was much more speculative. Increasingly, these services communicate and share metadata with one another. We have already seen our needs change over the course of our use of Islandora. Our understanding of our ability to meet those needs has changed as we have considered what services we could reasonably provide.

#### Content Recruitment and My Place Amongst Liaisons

The particular history of repositories and their management at UNB Libraries was, especially initially, difficult to address. Access to a given faculty often has felt dependent on the time and attention of liaisons in the space of scholarly communications. I am not interested in dwelling on where this has been challenging, but I am incredibly enthusiastic about the very near future.

In early 2017, I was asked by Marc Bragdon to be part of a "content recruitment task force" – as a of proof-of-concept for the broader "liaison librarian task force" exercise – where the members performed environmental scans and evaluated their faculty's interest or potential in open scholarship. Simultaneously, I perceived the "liaison librarian task force" and adoption of a new position description framework as a unique opportunity to make space for scholarly communications work in a more explicit way. Between these meetings, conversations with other liaisons and administrators, and the outcomes of the liaison retreat, I pulled together a draft document for my vision of where, based on the last 4 years, I can best serve my colleagues with my functional expertise.

Attached to this are two documents.

1. A draft version of a document called, "UNB Scholar Recruitment and Scholarly Communications Support at UNB Libraries". It is forthcoming, awaiting the approval and summation of the position description framework exercise.
2. The Scholarly Communications and Licensing/Copyright Position Description Framework.

I see these documents as the culmination of my time in this position. An attempt to express where I think I can best serve our community to my colleagues as they, in turn, evaluate their own approach to services. To me, they are in many ways the best measure of what I've learned in this position and how I have grown professionally – something that can be otherwise intangible. They are exciting.

## Scholarly Communications and Publishing Librarian

Of course, since late-2015, I also took on responsibilities representative of Scholarly Communications work in general. Because so much of the focus has been on the repository, many of these roles have really just begun to get off the ground over the course of the last six to eight months.

For example, our research data management services are barely launched. I do, however, serve on the library working group that has guided software selection, policy, documentation, and the development of services. This work has been performed under the primary guidance of Jamie Mackenzie, but it is clear that as we move forward with these services I will be needed increasingly for outreach, support, and instruction in this space.

Similarly, my work in author's rights and publisher policies is often done hand-in-hand with the copyright office. This typically takes the form of Joshua Dickison sending faculty my way after conversations about their copyright, or, when I have a conversation about open access and journal policies and forward someone to him.

This narrative of collaboration across departmental lines is consistent. I work with Siobhan and Jamie on research data services. I work closely with Jamie and systems in discussion new software platforms and potential integrations with other services to benefit researchers. I work with James Kerr and Erik Moore in journals work, with advocacy for our services, providing advanced support to editors, and in establishing a space for the CDS in national publishing initiatives. I do my best to help liaisons with questions from their researchers and in providing hands-on support where necessary. I field questions from graduate students, forwarded from Rob Glencross or the graduate school about repository policies, open access, bad-faith publisher solicitations, and accessibility (and I hope to be a louder voice for grad students in the future). I provide support for publishing initiatives technically through administration of – and education for – the Open Monograph Press platform. I work with faculty in identifying potential inroads for student journals. I work with cataloguing, archives, and the CDS in untangling our electronic theses and dissertations collection and service.

This is a space I continue to grow into, and one with many possibilities. Instruction frequency and variety will grow. Services to graduate students will be increasingly important. Relationships with ORS will get more and more vital in assisting researchers. My own technical literacy and ability will improve as I regularly learn new tools and platforms. I am excited in the opportunities afforded by stepping out of the Centre in a context where Islandora is largely stable and where our services are well defined.

### Professional Development / Staying Abreast of Trends

Day-to-day professional development takes place for me in a variety of areas. The nature of the narrative I watch changes depending on the sort of information I'm seeking. Current news and trends come quickly in the moment on Twitter, for example. It is an excellent way to get an on-the-ground view of news. I was able to pick up some valuable perspectives on the York copyright case, for example, by checking out shared takes and blogs throughout the week of the announcement. If I'm looking to follow development news and updates to relevant software, I'll follow pull-requests on Github or review the daily chatter on a project's Google group.

I keep abreast of trends and narratives in scholarly communications/tech in the following ways:

- twitter
- RSS feeds
    - scholarly kitchen // https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/
    - retraction watch // http://retractionwatch.com/
    - a list apart // https://alistapart.com/
- communities of practice
    - Canadian scholarly communications Slack group // scholcommincanada.slack.com
    - Public Knowledge Project Slack Group // pkpteam.slack.com
    - Public Knowledge Project Support Forum // https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/
- committees/working/interest groups
    - CAUL/CBUA Scholarly Communications Committee
    - PKP Documentation Interest Group
    - Islandora Metadata Interest Group
    - Islandora Documentation Interest Group
- listserv/user group
    - ETDs Google Group
    - Islandora User Google Group
    - REPOS-L
    - SCHOLCOMM-CARL-L
- development
    - GitHub organizations
        - Islandora // https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups
        - PKP // https://github.com/pkp
        - UNB Libraries // https://github.com/unb-libraries
- conferences and meetings

A good real-world example of this having a local impact was in February of 2017 when Beall's list was taken down. I fielded quite a few emails and questions about Beall, updated our OA pages on the library website to reflect a change in the narrative to improving literacy in the space of bad-faith publishing, and held information sessions for library folks and faculty. Not only was this work happening locally, but as Beall's story continued over the following few months I found the story on Twitter, the press, library blogs, and weighed in on CARL initiatives for new evaluation resources. I watched Beall – in real time – dismissively insult outspoken critics as #antilibrarians, social justice warriors, and decry #fakenews. All of these events occurred simultaneously with a process I underwent with Leanne in evaluating some journals and publishers for Business faculty, and served as an opportunity to steer some of the narrative on journals, publishers, open access, and metrics.

Additionally, my position as the chair of the CAUL/CBUA Scholarly Communications Committee more or less requires that I have a view of regional trends and news in the field. It also presents an excellent opportunity to steer projects and working groups that could benefit UNB. Use of the Slack platform means that I'm constantly connected to many different communities of practice and feel more capable of speaking authoritatively on how news items or trends are being received nationally. Any time my twitter feed and Slack channels are filled with library-related hot takes, I know I'll have information to share at the University of New Brunswick.

## Extra Curricular

### Public Knowledge Project / Érudit / Library Publishing Coalition

In my off-hours, I am employed by the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/) (PKP) at Simon Fraser University. PKP is "a multi-university initiative developing (free) open-source software and conducting research to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing". They are the makers of the Open Journal Systems, Open Monograph Press, and Open Conference Systems platforms. Together, these platforms provide the means for the dissemination of scholarship throughout the world, with over 10,000 OJS-hosted journals and a vibrant user/development community. The Centre for Digital Scholarship has long had a relationship with PKP, and my status within the organisation is of direct utility to the CDS in general. My role for PKP – _PKP Publishing Services Associate; Coordinator, PKP Documentation Interest Group_ – includes the following:

- management of support tickets via PKP’s OTRS and Accelo ticket management platform(s)
- documentation Interest Group Coordinator
    - responsible for organising monthly calls and communicating PKP documentation needs with interest group members
- creation of documentation for the PKP wiki and/or GitBooks, as well as changes to internal documentation utilising GitHub and static HTML generation via Jeckyll, Sphinx, and other dynamic page generators.
- assistance and monitoring of PKP Support Forum
-  instruction and training for PKP software including:
    - OJS
    - OMP
    - OCS

I'm also the resident expert on Crossref and DOIs, indexing, and public identifiers.

Part of the reason working for PKP was such a good fit for me (and for the library, really) is that the Centre for Digital Scholarship has a long history working with the organization. OJS has been the backbone of journals hosting at UNB Libraries for nearly eleven years, and I have been a part of that process since the beginning. Many former UNB/CDS folks work for PKP as well, and the community is tremendously collegial and well-regarded.

Over the course of the last year or two, this relationship has become increasingly useful for the CDS. PKP, alongside the Québecois publishing consortium Érudit, have been engaged in negotiations to begin a library publishing coalition that would seek to provide a framework for supporting open access, library-published scholarship. Érudit and PKP have worked relatively closely in the space of Canadian academic publishing since the Synergies project (where I served on the technical committee). As they drift together to create a platform where OJS-hosted journals can be distributed internationally via Érudit, I have found myself in a particularly vital role.

Érudit have, just like PKP, played a significant role in the CDS journals space. We have been one of very few places outside of the consortium to adopt their workflows and unique XML Schema. We are also the only place in the country who have utilized OJS and Érudit platforms simultaneously. This has placed us in the unique position as a vital pivot in the effort to pull the two organizations more closely together. This fall, I will be assisting Érudit in a series of podcasts/videos related to metadata fidelity and best practices, so that journals hosted on OJS at a variety of institutions can more easily contribute to this new coalition.

## Summary / TL:DR

I believe that I have met the assessment criteria laid out by the Collective Bargaining Agreement and my job description.  

I have, so far:

- led in or worked towards repository development, including:
	- islandora/UNB Scholar
		- continuing recommendations for modifications/integrations
		- ingesting materials
		- ingest workflows
		- etd management and recommendations
		- potential migration research
		- creating documentation for Islandora and workflows for best practices
		- modifying and created forms for new formats of scholarship
			- metadata creation
		- developing an in-depth, library-wide content recruitment framework that aims to target emerging scholarship leveraging existing relationships
		- developing policy with advisory group
	- dataverse research data management services
		- creating documentation for RDM services @ UNB Libraries
		- advising in technical space with regards to DOIs and repo software
		- early management and outreach
	- discussions/advising with regards to digital collections repositories
		- prospective, investigation for platform is ongoing
	- working closely with systems group to select platforms and customisations based on perceived needs
		- significant testing and bug reporting
- increased instructional duties
	- performing a number of thematic instructional sessions
	- planning for expansion of instruction to graduate students with increasing frequency
		- evaluating gaps and instructional potential with Jeannie Bail
	- performing time-sensitive and relevant instruction in the wake of specific news items  
- monitoring emerging trends
	- through use of social media, blogs, news media, and communities of practice.
	- sharing those trends with colleagues as necessary (worth noting that we can always work to improve internal communication)
- advocating for author's rights via copyright and open access discussions
	- in individual meetings with researchers
	- via ORS-hosted sessions related to grant applications and the Tri-Agency
	- professionally at conferences and in presentations
	- loudly to anyone who will listen
- continued support to digital publishing initiatives within the centre for digital scholarship
	- evaluating and playing a key role in migration of journals services to OJS 3.x platform
	- advanced support to hosted journals clients
	- adopting OMP platform for potential monograph publishing
	- early creation of student journals services using OJS
	- advising, support, and evaluation of initiatives against the backdrop of trends and common issues within the field
- represented UNB Libraries concerning scholarly communications and digital publishing
	- regionally in CAUL/CBUA as Chair of Scholarly Communications Committee
	- nationally in library publishing coalition talks and technical advising/proof of concept
	- nationally within community of practice
	- nationally within CARL discussions
	- locally in advocacy for the open scholarship created by UNB and hosted at UNB Libraries

Throughout, I believe this work to have been in direct support of the CBA. The work I do every day is about supporting the dissemination of the scholarship that occurs at UNB with the public of this province (and beyond). I believe my voice to be one that, both regionally and nationally, is respected in my field. I am under no illusions that our services in digital scholarship are perfect. I have made misjudgments in my career to date. It can be challenging to express "effectiveness" in a space so difficult to measure. But, my feeling is that our bumps in the road have led directly to my growth professionally and both the CDS and myself are stronger for them. I believe my presence to be effective at UNB Libraries, and I perceive myself as a uniquely-skilled member of this institution. I do my best to stay on top of both my technical skills and my professional development. I do my best to serve the library, and the UNB community, as best as I can. I continue to grow. I will continue to grow.
