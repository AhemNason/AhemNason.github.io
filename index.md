### BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION

ahemnason is Mike Nason,  a Scholarly Communications Librarian at the University of New Brunswick in sunny Fredericton, New Brunswick. He cares about things like open access to scholarly research and digital scholarship literacy. That's pretty fun. He works on repositories, outreach, digital projects, and sometimes reference. He doesn't "wear many hats" because he thinks that expression is super dumb... unless it is in reference to cycling caps. 

In his spare time he plays instruments, enjoys a good downward dog. IPAs, beards, plaid scarves, steel-framed bicycles... the whole deal. You know. 

You can reach him if you try.     
He has faith in you.
